# TURAArbitrage

TURAArbitrage is the core contract responsible for executing arbitrage opportunities in the TURA protocol.

## Features

- Risk-adjusted arbitrage execution
- Integration with TURARiskManager for risk assessment
- Support for multi-hop arbitrage paths

## Key Functions

- `executeArbitrage`: Execute an arbitrage opportunity

## Usage

Users interact with the TURAArbitrage contract to execute arbitrage opportunities. The contract ensures that all arbitrage actions are performed within the risk parameters defined by the TURARiskManager.

Note: This is a simplified implementation. In a real-world scenario, additional security measures and more sophisticated arbitrage logic would be required.
